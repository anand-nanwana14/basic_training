2. source & sh ?
source
- source is used to execute script within the current shell session.
- changes persist after the script finishes.
- source is for running in current shell environment with environment variables.
- source script.sh or . script.sh

sh
- sh is command used to start a new shell session.
- changes do not persist after the script finishes.
- it runs as a standalone script.
- ./script.sh or sh script.sh

3. Write a command to get the difference between the contents in two files?
- supposing a.txt and b.txt
- contents of a.txt = hello world
- contents of b.txt = hello world 
			    this is anand here
- we can use vimdiff command to check difference between contents of 2 files.

4. What is the difference between ls and lsof?
ls 
- Ls is the command used to list files and directories in the directory.
- there are many parameters that can be used like -a , -l ,etc

lsof
- lsof stands for list open files - we can list all open files on the basis of user -u, network -i, pid -p , etc
- It is used to gather information about open files and processes on a Linux system.

5. Create directories ./hello/world (World dir is inside hello dir) using mkdir command where neither hello or world exists. It should be a single command without the use of &&. 
- We can use -p paramater here to create this type of directories 
- -p is called parent directory 
- mkdir -p ./hello/world 

6. How can you permanently set an environment variable using a bash terminal?
- With the use of export command we can set an environment variable directly 
- echo "EXPORT variable=value" >> /.bashrc 
- Or we can vi the bashrc config file and can do changes there.

7. You have some process running on a port in your system. How can you view and then kill the process from the terminal?
- we can use lsof command to view the process of specific port no. like
- lsof -i :portno.
- And then it can be kill by kill command 
- kill pid - it will kill the process of the particular port
